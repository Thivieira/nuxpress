# nuxpress: Minimalist Plain Text blogging

**nuxpress** is the result of me reading through [VuePress][1]'s source code for
a week. It doesn't have blogging support yet, so I set out to try and cook 
something up with it. I learned a lot reading through Evan's code, but my 
feeling is that VuePress goes to great lenghts to replicate [Nuxt][2]'s 
functionality for automatically setting up and launching a Vue app.

While I see the value of having `vuepress` as a standalone CLI tool and 
everything it does that Nuxt doesn't (e.g., all SEO-friendly publishing tweaks), 
for me really its **golden feature** is streamlining Markdown in Vue files.

Now, I **really like** Nuxt's code organization standards. Having a blog as
a Nuxt app makes sense, as it would give me total freedom for customization.
VuePress's `eject` command gives you a similar functionality, but you miss
the multitude of plugins and Nuxt-oriented solutions out there.

So instead of trying to add blogging support to VuePress, I decided to add 
Markdown blogging support to a Nuxt app with the minimum amount of code 
and conventions I could possibly manage.

# Where the magic happens

<table>
<tr>
<td><b>nuxt.config.js</b></td>
<td>Supercharged with functions that load <code>.entry</code> files from a 
<code>entries/</code> directory. Generates RSS and Atom feeds using
<code>.template</code> files under <code>feeds/</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>plugins/entryLoader.js</b></td>
<td>Uses an index <code>entries.json</code> file (generated by 
<code>nuxt.config.js</code> to apply the Markdown transformation and inject 
`$entries` (a list) and `$permalinks` (a hash) in Nuxt's <code>app</code> 
context.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>pages/index.vue</b></td>
<td><code>asyncData()</code> makes <code>$entries</code> available to 
the template. Entries are automatically ordered by dates descending.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>pages/entry.vue</b></td>
<td><code>asyncData()</code> makes <code>article</code> available to 
the template, accessed via slug in the <code>$permalinks<code> hash.</td>
</tr>
</table>
