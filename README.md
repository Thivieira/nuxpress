# nuxpress: Minimalist Plain Text blogging

**nuxpress** is the result of me reading through [VuePress][1]'s source code for
a week. It doesn't have blogging support yet, so I set out to try and cook 
something up with it. I learned a lot reading through Evan's code, but my 
feeling is that VuePress goes to great lenghts to replicate [Nuxt][2]'s 
functionality for automatically setting up and launching a Vue app.

[2]: http://nuxtjs.org/

While I see the value of having `vuepress` as a standalone CLI tool and 
everything it does that Nuxt doesn't (e.g., all SEO-friendly publishing tweaks), 
for me really its **golden feature** is streamlining Markdown in Vue files.

Now, I **really like** Nuxt's code organization standards. Having a blog as
a Nuxt app makes sense, as it would give me total freedom for customization.
VuePress's `eject` command gives you a similar functionality, but you miss
the multitude of plugins and Nuxt-oriented solutions out there.

So instead of trying to add blogging support to VuePress, I decided to add 
Markdown blogging support to a Nuxt app with the minimum amount of code 
and conventions I could possibly manage.

## Where the magic happens

<table>
<tr>
<td><b>nuxt.config.js</b></td>
<td>Supercharged with functions that load <code>.entry</code> files from a 
<code>entries/</code> directory. Generates RSS and Atom feeds using
<code>.template</code> files under <code>feeds/</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>plugins/entryLoader.js</b></td>
<td>Uses an index <code>entries.json</code> file (generated by 
<code>nuxt.config.js</code> to apply the Markdown transformation and inject 
<code>$entries</code> and <code>$permalinks</code> in Nuxt's <code>app</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>pages/index.vue</b></td>
<td><code>asyncData()</code> makes <code>$entries</code> available to 
the template. Entries are automatically ordered by dates descending.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>pages/entry.vue</b></td>
<td><code>asyncData()</code> makes <code>article</code> available to 
the template, accessed via slug in the <code>$permalinks</code> hash.</td>
</tr>
</table>

If the loader encounters a directory under `entries`, it checks inside for an
`.entry` file and copies all other files to `/static/entries/`, so you can 
reference any assets in your `.entry` files

## Files that need customization

The `domain` constant in `nuxt.config.js`, then:

<table>
<tr>
<td><b>pages/*</b></td>
<td>Where <code>index.vue</code>, <code>entry.vue</code> and 
<code>archive.vue</code> live. As long as you understand and preserve the logic,
layout and CSS can be modified as you like.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>feeds/*</b></td>
<td>Lodash templates for RSS and Atom feeds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>layouts/default.vue</b></td>
<td>Nuxt's default layout, set up to use <code>components/LeftColumn.vue</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>components/LeftColumn.vue</b></td>
<td>The left column in the default two-column layout. This can be removed 
altogether and replaced by whatever layout structure you're using.</td>
</tr>
</table>
